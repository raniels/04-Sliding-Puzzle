# 04-image-puzzle

This is my attempt at the the 4th assignment in ils-z 399. From what I can tell it accomplishes the objectives of the assignment aside from adding other interesting features, due to time constraints. I decided to create a class so that if I decided add more methods in the future, I would not have issues with scope. The program also simulates many clicks so that you are essentially reversing what the changes were from the original positions. This was done so that the puzzle is always solvable as there are some instances if it was completley random where it would not be.
